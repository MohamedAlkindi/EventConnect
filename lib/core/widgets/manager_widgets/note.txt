Hello there future me! "and perhaps team members..."
So this folder will contain a replica of the code inside the attendee folder.
BECAUSE!
They're sharing the same look and feel of the UI FOR NOW
BUT NOT FOR TOO LONG!
As I'll "we'll" be updating the FULL UI in the near future so the manager has
a fully managerial "if thats a word" profile, and the same feeling for the user.
sooooo yeah
That's the reason and have fun!

From past self to future one, hope u have a good one!
